<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Ishaa, a second-year IT engineering student with a growing passion for web development and creating user-friendly digital experiences. Whether it's designing visually appealing websites or writing efficient code, I love the process of bringing ideas to life on the web.

  I'm currently building my skills in front-end and back-end development, with proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a keen interest in frameworks like React and Node.js. I enjoy working on projects that combine creativity with functionality, striving to make the web a more engaging place for everyone.

<p>At college, I'm an active participant in coding clubs and tech meetups, where I collaborate on projects and explore the latest trends in web technologies. My goal is to master full-stack development and contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.
  
  Outside of coding, I enjoy reading fiction-novels, playing chess, and listening to music. I'm also a huge fan of binge-watching tech talks and tutorials to keep my skills sharp and stay inspired.
  
  If you're interested in web development or have a cool project idea, let's connect and create something awesome together!</p>
